"Lynde, Francis, 1856-1930",Pirates' Hope,"Produced by Suzanne Shell, Emmy and the Online DistributedProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net(This book wasproduced from scanned images of public domain materialfrom the Google Print project.)","""Pirates' Hope"" by Francis Lynde is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Bonteck Van Dyck, a wealthy and somewhat disillusioned man, who invites his old college friend, Dick Preble, to join him on a cruise aboard his yacht, the ""Andromeda"". As they set sail, the novel explores themes of wealth, human nature, and the search for genuine relationships amidst a backdrop of luxurious seaside adventures.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Van Dyck, who is struggling with a sense of moral confusion and a desire to understand the people around him better, questioning their true natures beyond their polished exteriors. His invitation to Preble hints at an underlying mission to explore human authenticity among a selected group of socialites accompanying them on the cruise. As the ""Andromeda"" sets sail, conversations reveal complex relationships and a web of romantic and financial intrigues, particularly with discussions surrounding Van Dyck's musings about the guests and the legendary island of Pirates' Hope from which the book draws its title.
